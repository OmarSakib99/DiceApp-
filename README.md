# Dice App (Swift / iOS)

## Overview

This repository contains a simple **Dice iOS application** built using **Swift** as part of my learning journey in iOS development.

The project is based on the *“iOS & Swift – The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp”* course by **Angela Yu (Udemy)**. I initially cloned the course project and then made my own modifications to better understand Swift, UIKit, and iOS app architecture.

The app simulates rolling dice and updates the UI dynamically based on user interaction.
